                <p>I grew up in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, a country known for its multicultural environment and innovation, especially in making everyday activities more sustainable as seen through their Masdar City project. I was raised speaking predominantly English as my first language, but also know how to communicate in Arabic as it is my mother's language, and learned a few years of French in school. I'm also learning to speak Italian as a hobby, as I always found that language beautiful. I would be open to leanring more languages or spending time strengthening my weaker languages. I'd like to characterize my best traits to be push for creativity as I always try to think outside the box and try to produce unique ideas and different perspectives. I would also say I am a team player and would always ensure of doing my part in collaborative projects, and would often take the lead if the moment required it. One of my greatest weaknesses, however, is my concept of time as I often overestimate the amount of time I have or overshoot the length of time I may require when attempting to produce a new or creative idea. Despite this, I always found that I would get the job done in time, despite the mishaps I may have incurred earlier.

                 Currently I'm an Undergraduate Global Geography Student at <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/">York University</a> in Toronto, Ontario, Canada where I work towards attaining an undergrad degree along with a <a href="https://euc.yorku.ca/continuing-studies/certificate-in-geomatics-geographic-information-systems-gis-and-remote-sensing/">Geomatics Certificate</a>. I also plan to pursue my intreset in Geomatics and GIS by planning to do a Masters of GIS in the University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

                      My First years of Education were spent in a SABIS Ciculium, and I spent my years there from KG2 up until Grade 7. The School operated in a method of tedious daily exams and mainly focused on technical skills such as math and science.

                      I then moved into the all-girls British System, owned by Aldar Academies which is considered a relatively prestigious school. However, as the school was still newly established and there were a lot of loose ends, I have only spent two years: years 8 and 9.

                      For one of my CAS projects in IB, I conducted with a group of other students a group that aimed to promote sustainability and eco-friendly practices. One of our projects was to promote using reusable tote bags and encourage designing them to provide more traction and demand for them. In addition, we gave all the money we raised from selling the tote bags to the Red Cresent Charity Organization.

                    <p>
                      Since I did Higher Level Art in IB, one of my requirements for the course was to create, finish, and present an exhibition within the time frame of roughly 2 years. The artworks consisted of 9 pieces, and the all had to be connected by a theme. The theme I've chosen to do was the evolution of technology, and the relatioship it posesed with human interaction, and how it influnced a shift in culture.
